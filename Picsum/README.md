# Known Issues
+ Error Handling can be implemented if the api doesnt send a reponse. 
+ For now added a dummy data if the api returns an emty value. 
+ UI of the Cell can be implemented with better grid layout.

> Covering Approaches
+ Add Validating Service class where the API can be validated before the model value being assigned. (Validation Error)
